# Trash Detection System using AI

This project implements a trash detection system using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model.  It can identify various types of trash in images or video streams, which can be useful for automated waste sorting, litter monitoring, and other environmental applications.

## Overview

The system uses a custom-trained YOLOv5 model to detect and classify different categories of trash.  It provides real-time detection capabilities and can be adapted to various use cases.

## Features

*   **Object Detection:** Detects and classifies different types of trash (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, cardboard, etc.).  You'll need to define the specific classes relevant to your project.
*   **Real-time Processing:** Can process video streams or live camera feeds for real-time trash detection.
*   **Image Processing:** Can also analyze individual images for trash detection.
*   **Customizable:** The YOLOv5 model can be trained on a custom dataset to improve accuracy for specific types of trash or environments.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Provides tools for evaluating the model's performance (e.g., precision, recall, mAP).

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **Ultralytics YOLOv5:** The object detection framework.
*   **OpenCV (cv2):** For image and video processing.
*   **Google Colab:** For running python code.
